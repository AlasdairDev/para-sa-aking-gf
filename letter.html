                <p>I understand now truly, I do. I understand how you feel, and I want you to know that I’ve been praying about us, about this, every day. And yeah… I was going to tell you in person I wanted it to be perfect. But here I am, writing this to you instead, because love sometimes can’t wait for perfect moments. It just needs to be spoken. From the very beginning, I saw something in you that I couldn’t quite explain. You were and still are this radiant light in my life. You're loving. You're caring. You're funny, adorable, and so breathtakingly beautiful. You're like a rose to me delicate, vibrant, and always blooming. Like a snowball soft and rare, something you don't expect but can’t help but treasure. You understand me in ways no one else does. I know sometimes you feel like you’re a distraction but trust me, you're not. If anything, you’ve been a divine interruption. In the second quarter of the year, I remember praying: “Lord, if I could have a woman by my side a God-fearing woman one who walks with You, and one I could grow with, love with, worship with…” And then you appeared. Suddenly, everything made sense. So, I asked you,  Would you be mine? And now, a whole year later, I ask again, in a deeper way: Would you continue to grow with me, love with me, and walk in God’s light with me? It’s been a year. Can you believe it? A year of us. A year of growing pains, quiet joys, loud laughter, tough nights, and answered prayers. And yeah, I know I lost the sonnet I was going to use, but maybe this mess of words will do, because they come from the heart. I'm not stuck with you  I’m blessed to be with you. I thank God for carrying us through this year. It hasn’t been easy. This relationship tested our character. But more importantly, it revealed how love real love is patient, transforming, and rooted in something eternal. We've built something God is clearly working in, something slowly but divinely crafted. I’ve learned so much this year. About myself. About you. About what it means to really love. And you know what? A year ago, I popped the question in some random kitchen on a random Sunday but now I know there was nothing random about it. It was divine timing. We’ve had trials, sure. But we held on. And we kept our relationship centered on God, even when we stumbled. We leaned on Him  and because of that, we stood. "How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful!" (Song of Solomon 4:1) Like Shakespeare said: "Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate..." Truly, baby, you are. More lovely. More steady. More radiant than any season I’ve known. I look at you and I see someone fearfully and wonderfully made, someone hand-crafted by God. You're beautiful in ways the world can't measure kind, patient, joyful, and wrapped in grace. Like Daniel Caesar sings: “Yes I'm blessed but im glad to be stuck with you" You’re the best thing to happen to me. And you are. You really are. I know we're not married yet, so I don’t have the spiritual covering to fully lead you but I want you to know: I’m here. I pray for you. I want to intercede for you when you can’t find the words. I want to walk beside you through both ease and discomfort, because real love doesn’t grow in comfort zones. It stretches, it strengthens, it sanctifies. So here’s my prayer: That we never get too comfortable but we always stay grateful. That we grow in faith and in love. That we glorify God in everything together. And that this love of ours continues to bloom like the tulip you are. Happy Anniversary, my sunshine. My darling. My rose. My snowball. My best friend. Here's to more years, deeper roots, and a forever built on Him. I love you more than words, more than sonnets, more than this letter can hold.</p>
                <p>Happy Anniversary 💖</p>
                <p>Forever Yours,</p>
